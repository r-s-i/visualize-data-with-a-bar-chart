# United States GDP Bar Graph

This is my answer to freeCodeCamp's Visualize Data with a Bar Chart project. It displays the United States GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from the year 1947 to 2015 (3Q). When using a mouse, the graph is interactive. Hovering over the bars, a tooltip displays the date and GDP in billions of dollars.

## Getting Started

No installation is required to run this project. You can simply run the code by opening the index.html file in a web browser. [Or go to where I host it](https://robiniversen.com/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart).

## Data Source

The data is sourced from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json.
